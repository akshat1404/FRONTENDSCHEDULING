# About The Project

This project enables users to create schedules and routines efficiently. It sends daily email reminders about their tasks while tracking their streaks, successes, and failures.
Please note that this project is in its initial stages, and your contributions are highly appreciated!

## Steps to run 

1)Fork and Clone both the backend and frontend repos :
<a href="https://github.com/akshat1404/BACKENDSCHEDULING">Backend<a>
<a href="https://github.com/akshat1404/FRONTENDSCHEDULING">Frontend<a>

2) Frontend is set up in Reactjs (using npm), and Backend is set up in Nodejs, just like a regular code flow.

3) Create a new branch from the Master before sending a merge request.
